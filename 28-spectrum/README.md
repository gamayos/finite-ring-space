# Validation suite — *The Fermion Spectrum over a Finite Substrate*

**Repository:** <https://github.com/gamayos/frc-numerics/tree/main/28-spectrum>

This folder holds the computational verification for *The Fermion Spectrum over a Finite Substrate* (`../main.tex`). The scripts are standalone, deterministic, take no input, and print a human-readable verdict with a pass count; each is cited inline at the claim it backs in the paper's reproducibility paragraph (§Predictions and reproducibility).

## Framed-rational discipline

Every script is classed by how its asserted checks are computed:

- **EXACT** — every asserted check is performed in integer, modular `𝔽_p`, `𝔽_{p²}`, or cyclotomic (`ℚ(ω,√2)`, `ℤ[ℤ/3×ℤ/p]`) arithmetic. No floating point enters an asserted claim, and nothing exceeds the totality `Ω`. These carry the load-bearing exact identities of the mass sector.
- **MIXED** — an exact framed-rational core, with continuum constructs (`exp`, `log`, trig, `√` as a real number, measured PDG masses, random-coefficient robustness draws) confined to clearly-labelled `[approx]` comparisons. The exact claim never depends on the float part.
- **[APPROX]** — by construction a continuum / degenerate-idealisation comparison (a dimensional-transmutation estimate, a coupling-running anchor, the fine-structure reading). These are not exact framed-rational claims; they are the observer-chart reading of an `Ω`-hard object.

This is the corpus rule: an exact claim lives in finite, finite-field, or cyclotomic arithmetic; the continuum enters only as an explicitly labelled profinite / degenerate-idealisation approximation, and no realized magnitude exceeds `Ω`.

**Status.** All 16 scripts run and pass. The two **EXACT** scripts establish every load-bearing identity of the mass sector directly in framed-rational arithmetic, with the continuum reading held as a labelled `[approx]`:

- `exact_core.py` — the float-free core (25/25): the Koide identity natively over framed rationals in `𝔽_{p²}/𝔽_p` (the quarter-turn the rational `N(b)/a² = 1/2`, `Q = 2/3` exact on three shells); the amplitude diagonal `r² = N(1−ζ_n) = 2, 3` as integers in `𝔽_p`; the `π/12` boundary as an exact rational multiple of `π`; the Gauss-sum reality and `π/3`-quantisation as integer identities in the group ring `ℤ[ℤ/3×ℤ/p]`; the trimaximal magic matrix with maximal Jarlskog `J = Im ω/9 = √3/18 = 1/(6√3)` in `ℚ(ω)` (so `J² = 1/108`).
- `framed_koide.py` — the Koide and circulant facts natively over framed rationals: the "`√2` amplitude" is the framed rational `N(b)/a² = 1/2` and `ω` is the finite cube root, not a continuum complex number.

Class counts: **EXACT 2, MIXED 11, [APPROX] 3.**

## Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- `numpy`, `sympy`; `scipy` only for `tm2_jointfit.py` (the joint mixing fit)
- no other dependencies; no network, no data files

```bash
pip install numpy sympy scipy
```

## Running

```bash
python3 exact_core.py                                  # one script
for f in *.py; do echo "=== $f ==="; python3 "$f"; done  # whole suite
```

All scripts exit 0 and complete in seconds.

## Script → claim map

"Paper result" refers to the labelled results in `../main.tex`. "Class" is the framed-rational class above.

## Companion analyses (in `../reports/`)

- `../reports/delta-kernel/` — the phase-residue closure: `δ_LO = 3/8 − 1/3 = 1/24` framed-rational, the cube-invariant `Re(b³)`, and the result that neither a geometric (quarter-turn) nor a profinite derivation fixes `δ₀` (the drive-orientation Gauss sum equidistributes), so `δ₀` is `Ω`-hard with sub-horizon reading `Q/3 = 2/9`. Scripts `delta_push`, `last_step`, `route1`, `route2` (`*_20260628.py`).
- `../reports/review-response/` — the referee triage notes and their reproduction scripts (`review_check`, `round2_check`, `round3_check`), separating framed objects from labelled continuum comparisons. The asserted versions of these checks are folded into `revision_checks.py` here.

## Finitism audit

`../reports/finitism-audit/` is the standing cross-check that every load-bearing **EXACT** claim rests on integer / finite-field / cyclotomic arithmetic with no float or continuum step, and that the **MIXED** / **[APPROX]** continuum operations are labelled comparisons on which no exact claim depends. The audit re-does the three identified float relapses in `exact_core.py`; this README is kept in sync with it and with the in-paper reproducibility map.
